# Assessment Resources:

Studentâ€™s choice of Kaggle or Colab or another Jupiter notebook environment.

# Assessment Instructions:

### Example Scenario for Assessment
Imagine you work for a mid-sized e-commerce company specializing in environmentally friendly products. The company has experienced significant customer growth and as a result, the customer service department has become overwhelmed with the volume of inquiries received daily via email, social media, and the company website.

The company's leadership is interested in technologies that could improve response times and productivity while maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction. They wish to explore AI, ML, and DL solutions to automate parts of the customer service process.

Your task is to investigate and report on potential AI opportunities that will help manage the increase in customer inquiries more effectively and efficiently.

(optional: In discussion with your lecturer, you may choose to define your own real-world scenario in your workplace or otherwise of some personal interest to you)

### Instructions:
You should complete the following stages as part of your final project:

Task 1: Identify an Opportunity for Task Automation
Task 2: Consider AI, ML, & DL Technologies
Task 3: Assess the Suitability of Each Technique
Task 4: Recommendation and Justification
Task 5: Presentation

### Submission Evidence:
As part of your submission, you must include:

This document containing your written responses to tasks 1, 2, 3, 4, and the observation checklist providing evidence of satisfactory completion of task 5, completed by your lecturer.
