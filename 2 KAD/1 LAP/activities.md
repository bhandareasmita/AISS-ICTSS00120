Math—Optional but Highly useful!

We are at the point in the course where you have a decision to make.
Do I want to understand the math or do I want to focus on applying AI.

[Linear Algebra](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/linear-algebra)

[Calculus](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/calculus)

If you want a deeper understanding of how neural networks work, it will be important to brush up your math skills in each of these domains (in order, linear algebra and then Calculus). These videos present the concepts visually and give you some questions to check your understanding.

If you're strapped for time the most important topics to review are:
