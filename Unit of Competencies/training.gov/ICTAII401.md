## Application

This unit describes the skills and knowledge required to identify opportunities where artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) can be applied to support the automation of work tasks and improve organisational productivity.

The unit applies to individuals who may work across a wide range of information and communications technology (ICT) roles, including support technicians, system administrators, programmers and cloud systems administration support workers.

No licensing, legislative or certification requirements apply to this unit at the time of publication.

## Performance Evidence

The candidate must demonstrate the ability to complete the tasks outlined in the elements, performance criteria and foundation skills of this unit, including evidence of the ability to:

- report on at least one opportunity for each of the following technologies that may be applied in a workplace or organisation:
  - artificial intelligence (AI) technologies
  - machine learning (ML) technologies
  - deep learning (DL) technologies.

In the course of the above, the candidate must:

- make comparisons between the AI, ML and DL technologies
- apply required organisational policies and procedures.

## Knowledge Evidence

The candidate must be able to demonstrate knowledge to complete the tasks outlined in the elements, performance criteria and foundation skills of this unit, including knowledge of:
