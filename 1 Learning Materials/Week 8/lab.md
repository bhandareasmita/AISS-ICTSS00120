### Objective:
By the end of this lab, students will:
- Understand the importance of hyperparameter tuning in machine learning.
- Implement a spam email detection system using scikit-learn.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
- Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.

### Prerequisites:
- Basic understanding of Python programming.
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts and libraries (scikit-learn).
- A working Python environment with necessary libraries installed.

### Steps:

1. **Set Up the Environment:**
   - Ensure `scikit-learn` is installed:

2. **Load the Dataset:**
   - Download the spam dataset (e.g., SMS Spam Collection Dataset).
   - Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame:

3. **Preprocess the Data:**
   - Clean and preprocess the text data:

4. **Define the Model and Perform Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Implement a simple model (e.g., Naive Bayes) and use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning:

5. **Evaluate the Model:**
   - Transform the test data and evaluate the model

6. **Visualize Results:**
   - Visualize the confusion matrix

7. **Summary and Discussion:**
   - Summarize the key steps taken during the lab.
   - Discuss the model's performance, any challenges faced, and how they were addressed.

### Deliverables:
- A complete Jupyter notebook or code file with all implementations and visualizations.
- Short write-up (in markdown cells within the notebook) summarizing findings, challenges, and learnings.
